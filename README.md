# Mirage

**Mirage is what Reddit could have been if it hadn’t sold out.**

We are building true discourse without gatekeepers, decentralized by design and unstoppable in practice.

Instead of a corporate database, Mirage runs on **its own L1 blockchain** secured by battle-tested Tendermint-style consensus. This ensures that communities are durable, rules are transparent, and no single operator can rewrite history or erase your identity.

Crucially, **Mirage is not just for crypto users.** There are no wallets to install, no coins to buy, and no transaction fees to pay.

Instead, Mirage uses a **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** handshake to combat spam. Your device silently solves a cryptographic puzzle in the background to "pay" for your post. This allows for a completely permissionless, free-to-use network that remains resistant to bot attacks—solving the biggest problem of decentralized social media.

## Why Mirage?

Centralized platforms are broken. Admins deplatform communities overnight, and **power-tripping moderators** silence dissent on a whim. On Reddit, a handful of unaccountable "super-mods" control the flow of information for millions of people.

Mirage fixes this by changing the architecture of internet discussion:

- **No Authoritarian Moderation**: moderation is separated from content hosting. No moderator can delete your identity or social graph.
- **Node Choice**: if a node operator or their filters become tyrannical, you can simply switch to another node. Your identity and social graph follow you seamlessly.
- **Voluntary Filters**: moderation is opt-in. You choose which filters to apply and which curators to trust.
- **Unfiltered Truth**: because your identity and graph are not owned by any one website, you can always run your own node to bypass gatekeepers and see the raw reality of the network.
- **No Global Censorship**: a single operator can refuse to serve content on their specific node, but they cannot erase your identity from the network.

## How It Works

Most decentralized apps are hard to use. Mirage is different.

1. **Visit a Node**: Go to any public node (website) like [mirage.talk](https://mirage.talk). It looks and feels like a normal forum.
2. **Create an Account**: No email or phone number required. Your browser generates a cryptographic key pair locally. This is your "account."
3. **Start Posting**: When you post, vote, or reply, your browser signs the action and performs a lightweight **Proof-of-Work** calculation. This prevents spam without requiring you to pay transaction fees or hold tokens.
4. **Permanent Record**: The node broadcasts your signed action to the network. Once confirmed, its existence is permanent, and nodes can index and serve it.

## Why Run a Node?

Nodes are the backbone of the network, and the protocol rewards them directly.

- **Earn MIRAGE**: Node operators earn tokens simply for hosting a node, maintaining uptime, and strengthening the network's resilience.
- **Unfiltered Truth**: View the raw data directly from the chain and your node’s local index. Bypass other nodes' filters and see exactly what is happening on the network.
- **Sovereignty**: Run a community on your own terms. Set your own rules, theme, and culture without answering to a central authority.
- **Resilience**: Help secure the global ledger. The more nodes exist, the harder the network is to stop.

## Mirage vs. The World

Most “decentralized social” projects are forced to choose:

> If posting is free, bots will spam you. If posting costs money, onboarding dies.

Mirage uses **PoW** so normal users can post immediately without paying, while bots can’t spam at scale without burning real compute.

Here’s how Mirage compares at a high level (more detail + more platforms in `docs/comparison.md`):

| Dimension | **Mirage** | Centralized | Federated | Social L1 | Social L2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Decentralized?** | **✅ Fully** | ❌ No | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Onboarding** | **✅ PoW** | ✅ Email | ✅ Email | ❌ Wallet | ❌ Fees |
| **Anti-spam** | **✅ PoW** | ⚠️ Admin | ⚠️ Admin | ⚠️ Stake | ⚠️ Fees |
| **Switch nodes** | **✅ Seamless** | ❌ No | ❌ Hard | ✅ Easy | ⚠️ Mixed |
| **Can ban?** | **✅ No** | ❌ Yes | ❌ Yes | ❌ Yes | ❌ Yes |
| **Own identity** | **✅ Yes** | ❌ No | ❌ Admin | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Own graph** | **✅ Yes** | ❌ No | ❌ Admin | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Post record** | **✅ Yes** | ❌ No | ⚠️ Mixed | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Mixed |
| **Content hosting** | **✅ Nodes** | ❌ Site | ⚠️ Instances | ⚠️ Frontends | ❌ Hubs |
| **Moderation** | **✅ Opt-in** | ❌ Enforced | ❌ Enforced | ❌ Stake | ❌ Enforced |

### Category key (examples)

- **Centralized**: Discuit, Tildes, Squabblr, Scored, Disqus
- **Federated**: Lemmy, Mastodon, kbin, PieFed
- **Social L1**: Steem, Hive
- **Social L2**: Farcaster, Lens
