# Server Setup for a Mirage Node

This is the OS-level baseline every Mirage validator host must meet **before** running `deploy/deploy.sh`. It applies to fresh DigitalOcean droplets (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) and to existing hosts that need to be brought up to spec.

Skip nothing. Each step here addresses a real incident or a real near-miss in production.

> **Short version:** copy `deploy/harden_server.sh` to the host and run it. The script is idempotent, implements every step below, and **does everything by default** — writes every config, swaps docker.io for the official docker-ce + compose plugin, and reboots if a kernel update is pending. Opt out of specific side effects with `--no-migrate-docker`, `--no-restart-docker`, or `--no-reboot`.
>
> ```bash
> scp deploy/harden_server.sh root@<host>:/root/
> ssh root@<host> 'bash /root/harden_server.sh --weekly-hour=NN'
> ```
>
> Stagger `--weekly-hour` across the fleet (val4=04, val3=05, val2=06, val1=07) so no two validators ever restart in the same minute. Between hosts, wait for the one you just touched to come back and confirm it is signing again (a few blocks is enough); a long "soak" is not required — the cluster tolerates one host at a time and the hardening does not touch validator identity.

> Companion docs: [`deploy.md`](deploy.md) for the node software, [`troubleshooting/incident-recovery.md`](../troubleshooting/incident-recovery.md) for what to do when a validator goes sick.

## Target spec

| Item        | Value                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| OS          | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS                                       |
| Arch        | x86_64                                                 |
| vCPUs       | 2 minimum, 4 recommended                               |
| RAM         | 4 GB minimum, **8 GB strongly recommended**            |
| Swap        | **2 GB minimum (mandatory)**                           |
| Disk        | 80 GB SSD minimum (chain grows ~10 GB/year)            |
| Timezone    | `Etc/UTC`                                              |
| Kernel      | 6.8+ (Ubuntu 24.04 default)                            |

A DigitalOcean **`s-2vcpu-4gb-amd`** droplet works for testing. For production, use **`s-4vcpu-8gb-amd`** or larger — 4 GB RAM with no swap has caused an AppHash divergence in production (silent IAVL cache corruption under memory pressure).

---

## 1. Update the base system

```bash
apt update && apt -y full-upgrade
apt -y install ufw fail2ban unattended-upgrades curl ca-certificates gnupg htop iotop dstat jq
reboot   # if a new kernel was installed
```

---

## 2. Swap — 2 GB, mandatory

**Without swap, a transient memory spike on a busy validator can cause silent in-memory cache corruption** (page eviction races inside Go's runtime / IAVL `nodeCache`) without triggering an OOM kill. The kernel has no soft-fail buffer; the process either survives or dies, and "mostly survives" is exactly how AppHash divergence sneaks in.

```bash
# Create a 2 GB swapfile (idempotent — skips if already exists)
if [ ! -f /swapfile ]; then
  fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
  chmod 600 /swapfile
  mkswap /swapfile
  swapon /swapfile
  echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' >> /etc/fstab
fi

# Tune for a server (avoid swapping unless we really have to)
cat > /etc/sysctl.d/99-mirage-swap.conf <<'EOF'
vm.swappiness = 10
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50
EOF
sysctl --system

# Verify
swapon --show
free -h
```

You should see one entry under `swapon --show` and `Swap: 2.0Gi` in `free -h`. If both are empty, fix it before continuing.

---

## 3. SSH — key only, no passwords

Ubuntu 24.04 DigitalOcean droplets ship with two overlapping sshd drop-ins: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf` (cloud-init, sets `PasswordAuthentication yes`) and `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf` (the image, sets it back to `no`). **For `sshd_config` directives the FIRST value wins**, not the last — so 50-cloud-init.conf actually wins and password auth ends up enabled on fresh droplets. Our override therefore has to sort *before* 50-cloud-init.conf, not after:

```bash
cat > /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/00-mirage-hardening.conf <<'EOF'
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
PasswordAuthentication no
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PermitEmptyPasswords no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding no
MaxAuthTries 3
LoginGraceTime 30
ClientAliveInterval 300
ClientAliveCountMax 2
EOF

# Verify the merged config — the *Authentication lines should all be 'no' except Pubkey
sshd -T | grep -Ei 'permitroot|passwordauth|pubkey|kbdinteract|challengeresp'

systemctl reload ssh
```

**Before disconnecting**, in a *second* terminal, confirm you can still SSH in with your key. Lock yourself out over SSH and the fix is DigitalOcean's web console (see note below).

> **DigitalOcean web console is unaffected by `PasswordAuthentication no`.** The "Launch Droplet Console" button in the DO panel opens a hypervisor-level serial/VNC login that goes through PAM / `/bin/login` with the local `/etc/shadow` root password — sshd is not in the path. Disabling password SSH does not lose you the emergency recovery console. If you ever need it, set the root password via Access → Reset root password in the DO panel and log in at the serial console.

Authorized keys live in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Add team keys here, one per line. Remove keys when people leave.

---

## 4. Firewall (UFW)

Mirage validators expose exactly four inbound ports. Everything else stays closed.

```bash
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw default deny routed

ufw allow 22/tcp     comment 'SSH'
ufw allow 80/tcp     comment 'HTTP (cert renewal + frontend)'
ufw allow 443/tcp    comment 'HTTPS'
ufw allow 26656/tcp  comment 'CometBFT P2P'
ufw allow 26657/tcp  comment 'CometBFT RPC'

ufw --force enable
ufw status verbose
```

**Do not** open 1317 (REST), 9090 (gRPC), 5432 (Postgres), or 26658 (ABCI). They listen on `127.0.0.1` only and reaching them from the internet means something is misconfigured.

---

## 5. fail2ban

```bash
cat > /etc/fail2ban/jail.local <<'EOF'
[DEFAULT]
bantime  = 1h
findtime = 10m
maxretry = 5
backend  = systemd

[sshd]
enabled = true
EOF

systemctl enable --now fail2ban
fail2ban-client status sshd
```

---

## 6. Unattended security upgrades

Auto-apply security patches; do *not* auto-apply feature updates (those can change behavior under your validator).

```bash
dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades   # or just enable manually:
cat > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades <<'EOF'
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
EOF

# Reboots only happen at 03:30 if the kernel demands it
sed -i 's|//\s*Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot .*|Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "true";|' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
sed -i 's|//\s*Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot-Time .*|Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot-Time "03:30";|' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades

systemctl enable --now unattended-upgrades
```

---

## 7. Time sync

Consensus is height- and time-stamped. Drift breaks block proposing.

```bash
timedatectl set-timezone Etc/UTC
timedatectl set-ntp true
timedatectl status   # System clock synchronized: yes  /  NTP service: active
```

---

## 8. Docker

Use Docker's official APT repo, not the Ubuntu-shipped `docker.io` package. Mirage requires the `compose` plugin.

```bash
install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) stable" \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

apt update
apt -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

systemctl enable --now docker

# Verify
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Cap container log size so a chatty container can't fill the disk:

```bash
cat > /etc/docker/daemon.json <<'EOF'
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": { "max-size": "100m", "max-file": "5" }
}
EOF
systemctl restart docker
```

---

## 9. Kernel & ulimit tuning for a chain node

CometBFT opens a lot of file descriptors and sockets. Defaults are fine on small chains but tighten under load.

```bash
cat > /etc/sysctl.d/99-mirage-net.conf <<'EOF'
# Raise connection backlogs (P2P + RPC + reverse proxy)
net.core.somaxconn = 4096
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 4096
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10240 65535

# Reuse TIME_WAIT sockets quickly
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 15

# More room for the inotify watchers Docker / journald use
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288
fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 512
EOF
sysctl --system

cat > /etc/security/limits.d/99-mirage.conf <<'EOF'
*       soft    nofile  131072
*       hard    nofile  131072
root    soft    nofile  131072
root    hard    nofile  131072
EOF
```

Re-login (or reboot) for the `nofile` limits to take effect. Verify with `ulimit -n` — it should print `131072`.

---

## 10. Operational hygiene

### Weekly container restart

Bound the lifetime of in-memory state. Long-running Go processes can accumulate subtle GC fragmentation; a weekly restart is cheap insurance and was identified as a remediation step from a past apphash-divergence incident.

```bash
cat > /etc/systemd/system/mirage-weekly-restart.service <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Weekly restart of Mirage container
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker restart mirage
EOF

cat > /etc/systemd/system/mirage-weekly-restart.timer <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Restart Mirage container weekly
[Timer]
OnCalendar=Sun 04:00
RandomizedDelaySec=30m
Persistent=true
[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
EOF

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now mirage-weekly-restart.timer
systemctl list-timers mirage-weekly-restart.timer
```

**Stagger the `OnCalendar` hour across the cluster** — do not rely on `RandomizedDelaySec` alone. Current fleet assignment: val4=04, val3=05, val2=06, val1=07 (all UTC). `harden_server.sh --weekly-hour=NN` writes the right value per host.

### Disk monitoring

`/root/.mirage/` grows steadily. At 80% full, it's time to either bump the disk or prune older state.

```bash
df -h /
du -sh /root/.mirage/* 2>/dev/null | sort -h | tail -10
```

---

## Verification checklist

After running everything above, the host should pass every line:

```bash
free -h | grep -E 'Mem|Swap'                        # Swap row shows 2.0Gi
swapon --show                                        # one line, /swapfile, 2G
sshd -T | grep -E 'permitroot|passwordauth'          # prohibit-password / no
ufw status | grep -E '22|80|443|26656|26657'         # five lines, all ALLOW
systemctl is-active fail2ban unattended-upgrades docker   # active x3
timedatectl | grep -E 'NTP service|synchronized'     # both yes/active
docker compose version                               # prints a v2.x version
ulimit -n                                            # 131072
sysctl vm.swappiness net.core.somaxconn              # 10 / 4096
```

Every one of those should match. If any doesn't, fix it before deploying the node. Once the host passes, proceed to [`deploy.md`](deploy.md).

---

## Hardening the existing fleet

The four existing validators (`159.203.114.27`, `64.23.136.132`, `146.190.108.140`, `139.59.9.96`) were provisioned before this guide existed. Audit each with:

```bash
for ip in 159.203.114.27 64.23.136.132 146.190.108.140 139.59.9.96; do
  echo "=== $ip ==="
  ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 root@$ip '
    free -h | grep Swap;
    sshd -T | grep -E "^(permitrootlogin|passwordauthentication) ";
    ufw status | head -1;
    systemctl is-active fail2ban unattended-upgrades docker | tr "\n" " "; echo;
    docker compose version 2>&1 | head -1;
  '
done
```

Anything that doesn't match the verification checklist gets brought into compliance one node at a time, leaving at least 3 of 4 validators online during the work to keep consensus.

### Rolling the fleet with harden_server.sh

`scripts/fleet_audit.sh` is the read-only companion: it checks every validator against this baseline and flags mismatches without touching anything. Run it before and after a rolling hardening pass.

```bash
# Read-only audit across all four validators.
scripts/fleet_audit.sh

# Rolling hardening — one host at a time. Between hosts, just wait for the one
# you touched to come back and sign a few blocks; no long soak required.
for host_hour in "139.59.9.96:04" "146.190.108.140:05" "64.23.136.132:06" "159.203.114.27:07"; do
  host=${host_hour%:*}; hour=${host_hour##*:}
  scp deploy/harden_server.sh "root@$host:/root/"
  ssh "root@$host" "bash /root/harden_server.sh --weekly-hour=$hour"
  # Verify the host came back and is signing before moving on, e.g.:
  #   curl -sf http://$host:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info
  #   curl -sf http://$host:26657/block?height=... | jq .result.block.last_commit.signatures
done
```

On an existing host with a running mirage container, the default run involves three outage events stacked into a single maintenance window: docker engine migration (~1–3 min), possible docker restart to pick up daemon.json (~15–30 s; skipped if the engine was just reinstalled), and host reboot if a kernel update is pending (~60 s). The cluster must be 4/4 healthy before starting each host. Use `--no-migrate-docker` or `--no-reboot` if the window can't afford one of those right now.

### When an incident happens

Start at [`docs/troubleshooting/incident-recovery.md`](../troubleshooting/incident-recovery.md) — it is the index of every recovery procedure, which script to run, and which safety flags matter.
