# Seen Posts Tracking — Integration Guide

This document defines the viewability protocol that clients (web and mobile) must implement to track which posts a user has seen, so the server can downrank them in future feed responses.

## Architecture

```

```

## How Seen Data Affects the Feed

Seen posts are **not filtered** from feed responses. Instead, the server applies a **novelty factor (N)** that downranks previously-seen content:

```
N = 1 / (1 + 0.9 × view_count)
```

| view_count | N      | Effect on a post with base score 12 |
|------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| 0 (unseen) | 1.000 | 12.00 — full score                  |
| 1          | 0.526  | 6.32 — moderate downrank            |
| 2          | 0.357  | 4.29                                |
| 3          | 0.270  | 3.24                                |
| 5          | 0.182  | 2.18                                |
| 10         | 0.100  | 1.20                                |

- **Magic feeds** (home, following, topic, all): final score = `(S + V + U + P + A) × R × N`
- **Newest feeds**: ordered strictly by timestamp; `N` is always `1.0`
- Seen posts **can still appear** even when unseen posts exist — they just rank lower
- The `feed_debug` object in each post includes `N` and `seen_count` for transparency

## Post ID Format

All post IDs are full 64-character tx hashes (lowercase hex). Always normalize client-side by trimming whitespace and lowercasing.

## Viewability State Machine

Each post card transitions through three states:

```
not_seen ──→ exposed ──→ seen
```

- **not_seen**: Default. Post has not entered the viewport.
- **exposed**: Post has been in the viewport at least once but hasn't met any "seen" threshold yet. Track exposure count here.
- **seen**: Post crossed a threshold. Emit a seen event immediately (events can repeat across exposures).

### Transition Rules (not_seen → seen)

| Trigger | Condition | Reason string |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Click / open | User taps post to view detail | `open` |
| Vote | User up/downvotes the post | `vote` |
| Reply | User replies to the post | `reply` |
| Dwell | Mouse hovers over card for ≥3s (desktop) or ≥40% visible in active zone for ≥3s (mobile) | `dwell` |
| Glance | Mouse hovered ≥150ms then left, 2 exposures (desktop) or ≥30% visible then scrolled away, 2 exposures (mobile) | `glance` |

### Detection Modes

The client detects the viewport width and picks the appropriate strategy:

- **Desktop (≥769px wide + hover-capable)**: Uses `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` events on each card. Only the card under the cursor is tracked. Hovering ≥3s triggers dwell; hovering ≥150ms and moving away counts toward glance (2 hovers needed).
- **Mobile (<769px wide or no hover support)**: Uses `IntersectionObserver` with an active zone (top 8%, bottom 15% excluded). Cards ≥40% visible for ≥3s trigger dwell; cards ≥30% visible for ≥150ms then scrolled away count toward glance (2 scroll-bys needed).

The mode is re-evaluated on window resize (500ms debounce).

### Rules

1. **Foreground only**: Only count visibility time when the app is in the foreground.
   - Web: `document.visibilityState === 'visible'`
   - Mobile: track `onResume` / `onPause` lifecycle events
2. **Pause timers on background**: If the app goes to background mid-dwell, cancel the timer. Resume fresh when the app comes back.
3. **No client-side dedup**: Every glance/dwell event is sent to the server. If a user scrolls past the same post 10 times, `view_count` increments 10 times. The backend `ON CONFLICT` upsert handles accumulation.
4. **Interactions are immediate**: Click/vote/reply transitions happen instantly with no visibility check needed.
5. **One mark per viewing**: Dwell and glance run in parallel but only one fires per enter/exit cycle. If dwell fires (3s), glance state is cleared so the subsequent mouse-leave/scroll-away doesn't double-count. If glance fires first (2 hovers/scroll-bys before 3s), the dwell timer is cancelled.

## Reporting Protocol

All seen reports must be signed. Signature payload string (client-side):

```
seen_posts:<address-lowercase>:<timestamp-ms>:<envelope_nonce>
```

Include `pubkey`, `signature`, `timestamp`, and `envelope_nonce` in the POST body.

### Delivery: Periodic beacon flush (every 3 seconds)

A global 3-second interval timer flushes the buffer via `POST /api/seen_posts` whenever it has entries. This timer fires continuously regardless of which screen the user is on. It also fires immediately on app background / tab hide / page close.

```
POST /api/seen_posts
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "address": "mirage1abc...",
  "posts": [
    {"id": "<txhash>", "reason": "dwell"},
    {"id": "<txhash>", "reason": "glance"}
  ],
  "pubkey": "<base64 pubkey>",
  "signature": "<base64 signature>",
  "timestamp": 1712940000000,
  "envelope_nonce": 123456789
}
```

- Web: use `navigator.sendBeacon()` for the POST
- Mobile: use a standard HTTP POST
- The timer starts on the first `markSeen` call and runs for the lifetime of the app session (not tied to any single screen)
- Maximum **100 entries** per batch
- Response: `{"ok": true, "ingested": <count>}`

## Mobile Implementation Guide

### React Native (FlatList / FlashList)

Use `onViewableItemsChanged` with a custom viewability config:

```javascript
const viewabilityConfig = {
  itemVisiblePercentThreshold: 30,
  minimumViewTime: 150,
};

const onViewableItemsChanged = useCallback(({ viewableItems }) => {
  if (AppState.currentState !== 'active') return;
  for (const item of viewableItems) {
    const pid = item.item?.post_id;
    if (!pid) continue;
    recordExposure(pid); // single glance marks as seen
  }
}, []);
```

For dwell detection, start a 3-second timer when a post becomes viewable and cancel it when it leaves. Only count time while `AppState.currentState === 'active'`.

### Native Android (RecyclerView)

Attach an `OnScrollListener` or use a custom `LayoutManager` callback to track which `ViewHolder` items have ≥30% visibility. Use `Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE` / `ON_RESUME` to gate tracking.

### Native iOS (UICollectionView)

Use `UICollectionViewDelegate` methods (`willDisplay` / `didEndDisplaying`) combined with a periodic check for center-band positioning. Gate on `UIApplication.State.active`.

### Mark on Navigation

When the user taps a post to open the detail view, immediately call `markSeen(postId, "open")`. This must work regardless of which screen the user is on — the buffer and flush timer are global, not tied to the feed screen.

Similarly, call `markSeen(postId, "vote")` on vote and `markSeen(postId, "reply")` on reply. These are instant transitions — no visibility check needed.

### Flush on Background

```javascript
// React Native
useEffect(() => {
  const sub = AppState.addEventListener('change', (state) => {
    if (state === 'background' || state === 'inactive') {
      flushSeenBuffer(); // POST /api/seen_posts
    }
  });
  return () => sub.remove();
}, []);
```

## Error Handling

- **Bounded retries**: Maximum 2 retries for the beacon/flush endpoint. Drop buffer after that.
- **No infinite loops**: If flush fails twice, discard the buffer and move on.
- **Graceful degradation**: If seen tracking fails entirely, the feed still works — users just see some repeat posts (with full scores, since N defaults to 1.0).
- **No blocking**: Seen ingestion must never block the feed response or the UI thread.

## Server Behavior

- The server stores full post IDs per user and keeps only the **most recent 1000** entries (deque semantics).
- Each seen entry tracks a **view count** that increments on every subsequent report of the same post. Re-sending an already-seen ID is not a no-op — it bumps the counter and refreshes the timestamp.
- On feed requests, the server loads the user's seen map and applies a **novelty multiplier** `N = 1 / (1 + 0.9 × view_count)` to downrank seen content. Seen posts are never hard-filtered.
- The user's **own posts from the last hour** are always included in the feed. Own posts older than 1 hour are treated like any other post.
- Guest users have no seen tracking (N = 1.0 for all posts).
- The seen map (post ID → view count) is cached in-memory on the server (120s TTL) so repeated page loads don't hit the database.
